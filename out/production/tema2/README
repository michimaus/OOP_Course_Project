League of OOP


StandardPlayer - mother class that keeps the basic data for each player. Each race gets its own
extension of the StandardPlayer where specific data is retained for each hero type.

The Map instance is a Singleton. Also tricked the instances of the spells by adding the object
of the class -where the methods for the spells are implemented- as a field in the Map class.
Moreover the interaction between the heroes are done by a method in Map class, that checks
if two players are to be found at the same coordinates.

Spells that affect the heroes are implemented based on the Visitor Pattern. The definition
for the logic of the spells is implemented in a class that is independent by the hero itself.
Each spell has its base definition and after this the outcome of the spell is asociated with
a specific visitor that applies the effect based on the race that gets hit.

For input and output I used the provided fileIo.jar. Implemented two classes -DataLoader and
InputOutputStream- for processing the raw data taken from theinput file, taking it to the 
specific fields of the game engine  and printing the output in the specific file
