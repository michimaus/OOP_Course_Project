README - League of OOP


StandardPlayer - mother class that keeps the basic data for each player. Eache race gets its own
extension of the StandardPlayer where specific data is retained for each heroe type.

The Map instance is a single tone. Also tricked the instaces of the spells by adding the object
of the class -where the methods for the spells are implemented- as a field in the Map class.
Morover the interaction between the heroes are done by a method of the Map class, that checks
if two players are to be found at the same coordinates.

Spells that affect the heroes are implemented baseed on the visitor pattern. The definition
for the logic of the spells are implemented in a class that is indepent by the hero itself.
Each spell has its base definition and after this the outcome of the spell is asociated with
a speicific visitor that applies the effect based on the race that gets hit.

For input and output I used the provided fileIo.jar. Implemented two classes -DataLoader and
InputOutputStream- that are getting the job done with processing the raw data taken form the
input file, taking it to the specific fields of the game engine, and printing the output in
the specific file.
